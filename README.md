# Horiseon's refactored website for accessibility

## Description

This project took exisiting code of a website and refactored it. Improvements include: making sure all links are functioning correctly, minimising CSS code repetitions, using semantic HTML elements, using alt attributes for images and icon elements and giving a concise and descriptive title to the webpage. 

The reasoning behind this project was that Horiseon marketing agency wanted a codebase that followed accessibility standards, so that their website it optimized for seatch engines. 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website. 

There were no challenges with this project.
